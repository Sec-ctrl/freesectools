    Headings: #f5f5f5 (Slightly Lighter Gray)
    Primary Accent: #8a2be2 (Vibrant Purple)
    Secondary Accent: #3b4a54 (Steel Blue)

Usage:

    Background: Always use #1e001e for the main background to maintain the dark, hacker-theme aesthetic.
    Headings: Use #f5f5f5 for headings to ensure clear contrast with the background.
    Text: Use #d3d3d3 for body text, #e6e6e6 for sidebar and smaller text elements.

2. Typography
Font:

    Use clean, modern fonts that are easy to read across all devices.
    Primary Font: A sans-serif font like Roboto or Montserrat works best.
    Weight: Use font-weight: 800 for headings and font-weight: 400-700 for body text.

Text Styling:

    Headings (h1-h6): Always use #f5f5f5 for headings. Size and weight should emphasize hierarchy:
        H1: 4rem, 800 weight
        H2-H6: Gradually smaller with lighter weights.
    Body Text: Use #d3d3d3 for paragraphs, lists, and general content.

Letter-spacing and Text-transform:

    Heading Classes: Apply text-transform: uppercase and letter-spacing: 0.1rem for a clean and authoritative look.
    Text Shadow: Add text-shadow: 0 0 8px rgba(138, 43, 226, 0.8) for a slight glow effect on key titles.

3. Buttons
Primary Button (btn-primary):

    Background Color: #8a2be2
    Hover/Active State: #7a23d1 for hover or focus states.
    Text Color: Always #ffffff for clear contrast.
    Border: Match the background color for consistency.

    Text Color: #8a2be2
    Hover: Switch the background and text color to:
        Background: #7a23d1
        Text: #ffffff

Button Transitions:

    All buttons should have a smooth transition effect: transition: background-color 0.3s ease, border-color 0.3s ease.

4. Navbar
Background:

    Use a dark gradient (linear-gradient(135deg, #1e1e1e, #2c2c2c)) for a sleek look with depth.

Link Colors:

    Inactive Links: #e0e0e0
    Hover State: #472d63 with a background color change for interactivity.
    Active Links: #582a72 for the active page with a slight shadow highlight (box-shadow: inset 0 -4px 0 rgba(138, 43, 226, 0.8)).

Brand Logo:

    Always use #8a2be2 for the brand logo. On hover, the brand color can shift to #472d63.

5. Cards & Sections
Card Backgrounds:

    Use #2c2c2c as the background color for all cards.
    Text Color: #ffffff for titles and #e0e0e0 for body text.
    Shadows: Apply box-shadow: 0 6px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3) for depth.

Content Sections:

    Use #2a2a2a as the background for content sections with a slightly lighter border (border: 1px solid #444444).

Borders:

    Use vibrant purple (#8a2be2) sparingly for top/bottom borders, especially in special sections (e.g., .why-freesectools-section).

6. Icons & Visual Elements
Icon Size:

    Maintain a consistent size of 60px for custom icons.

Hover States:

    Apply a subtle zoom effect (transform: scale(1.05)) and brightness increase (filter: brightness(1.2)) for icons on hover.

Text Shadows:

    For major titles and important visual elements, apply a glow effect using text shadows like:
        text-shadow: 0 0 8px rgba(138, 43, 226, 0.8).

7. Interactive Elements
Links:

    Default Color: #d67fe7
    Hover Color: #8a2be2
    Underline: Use text-decoration: none to remove default underlines.

Form Controls:

    Input Background: #2c2c2c for dark backgrounds.
    Placeholder Text: Use white with opacity for subtle placeholders.

8. Spacing & Layout
Padding:

    Apply consistent padding for all sections:
        Cards: padding: 20px
        Content Sections: padding: 20px 30px
        Buttons: Ensure padding matches typography, i.e., padding: 10px 20px for a button.

Margins:

    Add a margin between sections and elements for visual clarity:
        Sections: margin-bottom: 20px
        Titles: margin-bottom: 1.5rem

Border Radius:

    Cards & Sections: Apply border-radius: 10px for a rounded and modern look.

9. Animation & Interactivity
Background Animation:

    Apply a subtle movement animation to background elements, e.g., the SVG pattern:

    css

    animation: backgroundAnimation 60s linear infinite;

Hover Effects:

    Buttons, Icons, and Links: Add hover effects that involve:
        Color change
        Slight zoom (transform: scale(1.05))
        Box shadows (box-shadow: 0 6px 12px).

10. Accessibility

    Text Contrast: Ensure text color has sufficient contrast against backgrounds. For dark backgrounds, use light text (#d3d3d3 or lighter) to ensure readability.
    Focus States: Ensure all interactive elements (links, buttons, etc.) have clear focus states for keyboard users.
